# R.F. Resina Forlivese Brand Guidelines

These guidelines define the visual and motion identity for the R.F. Resina Forlivese S.r.l. digital experience.

## Design Philosophy
**Industrial Cinematic**: The website should feel like a premium documentary or a luxury car configurator. Powerful, precise, and immersive.

## Color Palette
| Name | Hex | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deep Black** | `#0a0a0a` | Main background, text on white sections |
| **Pure White** | `#ffffff` | Background for "clean" sections, primary text on dark |
| **Dark Navy** | `#1a2744` | Header, Footer, primary brand color (from logo) |
| **Anthracite** | `#2d2d2d` | Section backgrounds, secondary surfaces |
| **Steel Blue** | `#4a6fa5` | Accents, borders, interactive elements |
| **Gold** | `#c9a96e` | Premium highlights, small decorative elements |
| **Sustainable Green** | `#4CAF50` | Sustainability section, signature leaf icon |

## Typography
- **Headings**: `Clash Display` (or `Satoshi`/`Bebas Neue` as fallbacks).
  - Style: Bold, Uppercase for Hero and main Section Titles.
  - Tracking: Slightly increased for a premium feel.
- **Body**: `Inter` (or `DM Sans`).
  - Style: Regular for text, Medium for links and subheaders.
- **Data/Counters**: `Monospace` (for count-up animations).

## Motion Principles
- **Smoothness**: Use `Lenis` for high-quality smooth scrolling.
- **Storytelling**: Sections should reveal content sequentially as the user scrolls.
- **Interaction**: Magnetic effects on primary CTA buttons.
- **Cursor**: Custom ring cursor that expands/transforms over interactable areas.

## Assets
- **Video**: Use dark, high-contrast industrial footage (polyurethane cutting, factory floors).
- **Icons**: Minimalist, animated SVG paths.
